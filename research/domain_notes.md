# Domain Finding Notes

## PrepLogger.com
Pro: Lets users filter questions based on problem level and the problem tags. Also adds a choice to record how long it takes to find solutions and implement solutions. Also includes total hours spent on solving Leetcode problems

Improvements: Doesn’t include hyperlinks that take users directly to the questions on Leetcode. 

## HackerRank.com
Pro: Very quick filtering of solved and unsolved problems

Improvements: Points are a bit ambiguous. Problems also do not have tags so it’s hard to identify the topics a problem belongs to. 

## DittoCode.io
Pro: Using dittocode.io website, we can see our Leetcode progress visually using the pie charts. The use of pie charts makes it easier to visualize the progress in terms of difficulty and type.

Improvements: In the website, users should be able to find useful collections of coding interview questions such as Blind75, Neetcode150. Thus, the users can also visualize their progress with those popular collections of interview questions.

## NeetCode.io
Pro: In neetcode.io website, the users can find two of the most popular collections of interview questions. It is also quite easy to navigate between two collections. The users can see their progress using a simple progress bar in both collections. 

Improvements: Neetcode.io website does not show progress based on difficulty like dittocode.io. It only shows the progress based on the number of questions completed. 

## LeetCode.com
Pro: Leetcode.com has basically everything users need to prepare for the coding interview. Users can solve the question in the website and submit the solution to get evaluated. The users can have access to company-specific questions if they pay for the premium. There are also useful collections of interview questions such as Leetcode 75, Leetcode Curated SQL 70 and more. 

Improvements: However, the users might want the whole package of job preparation. For example, the users might want some sort of list to keep track of the job applications they have submitted. Leetcode does not provide some sort of organizational tool regarding the job application process.
