# Interview Notes

## Manan 
1. Do you keep track of your leetcode progress (i.e. total questions completed, or like total medium questions completed, etc.)? If so, how do you keep track of your leetcode progress? 

- No, not at all. Didn’t even think about it. Would be nice to have something like that that does it for you. 

2. Do you feel like it is useful to keep track of your leetcode progress? Do you think other people keep track of (or would like to keep track of) their leetcode progress? 

- Yeah, you might end up repeating something you’ve done, (like grey it out for you or hide). People that do it more than me would. 

3. How do you choose what leetcode questions to do?
Based on difficulty (i.e. only mediums, or easy, or hard, or mix)?
Question collection (i.e. Blind 75, NeetCode 150, etc)?
Topics (i.e. Arrays, hash tables, binary trees, etc)? 

- If wanted to be well rounded, will probably do it based on difficulty. But if have certain weakness, then will do topic based. 

4. How do you feel about the ways that you choose which leetcode questions to do? Do you feel like it is effective? Do you think that there are other more effective alternative approaches?

- Use extensive Filtering. Knowing what you’ve done and what you’ve not done. Maybe make a recommender system, Leetcode has a way to find what you’re weak at. Would be useful if it outright tells you what you bad at. Or also recommending things you haven’t done. 

5. Do you follow any collection of questions, such as the NeetCode 75? If you have heard of them, how do you feel about these collections? Do you think they are useful? 

- Also very useful. Have heard of them, test the more frequent questions. Take from previous interview questions that have already been done, so should be trustworthy collections. 

6. If I asked you, How many hard, medium, and easy leetcode questions have you completed so far, would you know how to find the answer? And how? 

- I don’t know, cause it’s been so long. But there’s many alternatives like HackerRank that show your progress and it has a better UI than LeetCode. What questions you haven’t done are more useful. You can do something you haven’t tried. 
LeetCode. The filters for ToDO and Completed is very useful. 

## Bolanle
1. Do you keep track of your leetcode progress (i.e. total questions completed, or like total medium questions completed, etc.)? If so, how do you keep track of your leetcode progress? 

- I do keep track of my LeetCode progress. There’s an inbuilt tracker in the app so I know how many questions, how many types of sub-topic questions I have answered

2. Do you feel like it is useful to keep track of your leetcode progress? Do you think other people keep track of (or would like to keep track of) their leetcode progress? 

- It is very useful! I usually have a target of how many leetcode questions to solve in a week, so that gives me a value to base my efforts
I definitely think other people would like to. Anything tha thas quantity needs a way of measurement I think

3. How do you choose what leetcode questions to do?
Based on difficulty (i.e. only mediums, or easy, or hard, or mix)?
Question collection (i.e. Blind 75, NeetCode 150, etc)?
Topics (i.e. Arrays, hash tables, binary trees, etc)? 

- I choose based on difficulty once in a while. But usually I use the most frequently occurring set for companies I’m interested in like Apple or Google or whatever’s problem set

4. How do you feel about the ways that you choose which leetcode questions to do? Do you feel like it is effective? Do you think that there are other more effective alternative approaches?

- I have also checked out question collections like Blind 75 but not really. It’s very overwhelming for me to approach things like that; I much prefer by concepts like array questions or linked list questions

5. Do you follow any collection of questions, such as the NeetCode 75? If you have heard of them, how do you feel about these collections? Do you think they are useful? 

- I feel like the way I choose has been effective for me. Lots of people say to use Blind 75 or Neetcode but understanding the overall concept first has been more important to me. I actually think lists like that do more harm than good to new interviewees. They get so daunted and it can be very discouraging to them. I would suggest that people learn concepts first, and then solve easy questions on that concept, then medium and then they can move on to the next concept. Only after that should they attempt a Blind 75 list

6. If I asked you, How many hard, medium, and easy leetcode questions have you completed so far, would you know how to find the answer? And how?

## Minh

1. Do you keep track of your leetcode progress (i.e. total questions completed, or like total medium questions completed, etc.)? If so, how do you keep track of your leetcode progress?

- I use the dashboard to keep track of the questions that I attempted. 

2. Do you feel like it is useful to keep track of your leetcode progress? Do you think other people keep track of (or would like to keep track of) their leetcode progress? 

- I think it is useful since it shows me how many questions that I attempted. Was it easy/medium/hard. When did I attempt them. I think other people also keep track of their progress. 

3. How do you choose what leetcode questions to do?
Based on difficulty (i.e. only mediums, or easy, or hard, or mix)?
Question collection (i.e. Blind 75, NeetCode 150, etc)?
Topics (i.e. Arrays, hash tables, binary trees, etc)? 

- Based on the difficult level. In addition I use the company tag to strategically target a specific company. 

4. How do you feel about the ways that you choose which leetcode questions to do? Do you feel like it is effective? Do you think that there are other more effective alternative approaches?

- I pick the question based on the topic that I want to focus on. In addition, I also follow blind75 and neetcode. I think these collections are useful since they cover pretty much cover all the core concepts of ds and algorithms. 

5. Do you follow any collection of questions, such as the NeetCode 75? If you have heard of them, how do you feel about these collections? Do you think they are useful? 

- I did 61 questions so far. 39 medium, 22 easy. I was able to figure them out based on the solution section or just googling the solution.
